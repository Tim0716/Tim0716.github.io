I am an Economics PhD Candidate at Stellenbosch University, researching the long run growth of the South African economy. I study miss-allocation and productivity inefficiencies associated with political institutions of Apartheid and the related welfare costs. I am on the Job Market in 2025

My research interests are in Economics of Long run growth and Development, Economic History, Applied Microeconomics and Macroeconomics and can likewise teach these and related theory.

I am also passionate about data science applications of economics and econometrics to policy and industry solutions.

I am affiliated to Laboratory for Economics of Africa's Past (LEAP) chaired by Prof Johan Fourie who is also my letter writer
