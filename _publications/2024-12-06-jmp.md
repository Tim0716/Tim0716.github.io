In the 20th century, manufacturing emerged as a dominant force in South Africa’s economy, coinciding with the institutionalization of Apartheid policies that entrenched racial discrimination in labor markets. Under Apartheid, skilled jobs were reserved for white workers, while African workers were relegated to unskilled roles. To address the resulting shortage of skilled white labor, firms deconstructed complex tasks into simpler units, enabling compliance with discriminatory laws while expanding industrial productivity. This paper examines the interplay between rail infrastructure improvements and productivity during this period, focusing on how railroad enhancements influenced aggregate productivity and allocative efficiency in manufacturing. The analysis provides a pseudo-test of Becker’s theory of discrimination by assessing whether economic forces counteracted Apartheid labor policies.

Using digitized regional manufacturing census data from 1970, 1980, and 1985, along with regional output data and geospatial railroad maps, this study investigates the impact of transitioning railroads to diesel and electric systems. Recognizing the potential endogeneity of infrastructure upgrades, a straight-line instrument connecting major cities is employed to isolate exogenous variation in railroad improvements. The results reveal that railroad enhancements significantly increased both productivity and allocative efficiency, suggesting that economic imperatives posed a challenge to discriminatory labor practices. Robustness tests with varying definitions of outcome and treatment variables support these findings. This study underscores how internal economic dynamics, alongside international pressure, threatened the sustainability of Apartheid-era policies.
