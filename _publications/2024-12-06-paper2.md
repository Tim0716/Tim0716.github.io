Growth in 20th Century South Africa cannot be fully explained without considerations of the legacy of Apartheid. It is a period that saw the establishment of the union of South Africa around a strong mineral resource foundation of the economy. It is also a period that saw the expansion and domination of the manufacturing industry. The dynamics of growth in the 20th century South Africa are thus significantly affected by the interaction of its factors amidst government policies and restrictions on labour. In this paper, I estimate the production functions for Mining and manufacturing in South Africa to account for their evolution during the century. I further estimate elasticities of substitution between White and Black labour as well capital and Aggregate labour, to decompose Aggregate technical change’s contribution to output growth by labour type and capital. While technical efficiency was important for manufacturing, it was not as important in Mining. A racial wage premium wedged by Apartheid policies did affect Black worker’s efficiency and contribution to output growth. I quantify these effects in this paper.
